            <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
            <div class="story-body">
                           <p>I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a farthing from
                me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.</p>

            <p>When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I
                started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which
                I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side
                window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.</p>

            <p>'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to
                go out to-night?'</p>

            <p>'Certainly not.'</p>

            <p>'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see
                someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'</p>

            <p>'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is
                fastened?'</p>

            <p>'Quite sure, dad.'</p>

            <p>'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.</p>

            <p>I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg
                that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."</p>

            <p>On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."</p>

            <p>I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy
                sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in
                the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it
                had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with
                all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next
                room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room
                door.</p>

            <p>'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'</p>

            <p>The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was
                standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or
                bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
                snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
            </p>

            <p>'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured me
                forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'</p>

            <p>'Stolen!' he cried.</p>

            <p>'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>

            <p>'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.</p>

            <p>'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I
                not see you trying to tear off another piece?'</p>

            <p>'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word
                about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make
                my own way in the world.'</p>

            <p>'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this
                matter probed to the bottom.'</p>

            <p>'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his
                nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'</p>

            <p>By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush
                into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the whole story and, with
                a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
                investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur,
                who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with
                theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the
                ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
            </p>

            <p>'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as
                mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'</p>

            <p>'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then,
                realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my
                honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a
                scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done
                with the three missing stones.</p>

            <p>'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make
                your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the
                beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'</p>

            <p>'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer. I saw
                that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called
                in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his
                room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of
                them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.
                This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have
                hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly
                confessed that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
                necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my
                honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"</p>

            <p>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child
                whose grief has got beyond words.</p>

            <p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
            </p>

            <p>Do you receive much company?" he asked.</p>

            <p>None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been
                several times lately. No one else, I think."</p>

            <p>Do you go out much in society?"</p>
